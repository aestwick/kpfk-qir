## P0 — Do Before Going Live ✅ COMPLETE

### 1. Add Missing Database Indexes ✅

Added migration `supabase/migrations/002_add_indexes.sql` with indexes on:
- `episode_log(status, air_date)` — pipeline queries
- `episode_log(mp3_url)` — deduplication
- `transcripts(episode_id)` — joins
- `usage_log(created_at)` — cost analytics

### 2. Add OpenAI Retry Logic with Backoff ✅

Added exponential backoff in `workers/summarize.ts` — retries up to 3 times on 429, 500, 502, 503 errors with 2s/4s/8s delays before marking as failed.

### 3. Add BullMQ Job Timeouts ✅

All workers in `workers/index.ts` now have timeouts, attempts, and exponential backoff:
- Ingest: 5 min timeout, 2 attempts
- Transcribe: 10 min timeout, 2 attempts
- Summarize: 2 min timeout, 2 attempts
- Generate QIR: 5 min timeout, 2 attempts

## P1 — Next Sprint ✅ COMPLETE

### 4. Separate Workers from Web Server ✅

`docker-compose.yml` now has separate `qir-app` (web only, `npm run start`) and `qir-worker` (workers only, `npm run workers`) services using the same image.

### 5. Docker Resource Limits ✅

- `qir-app`: 1g memory, 1.0 CPU
- `qir-worker`: 2g memory, 1.5 CPU (headroom for ffmpeg)
- `qir-redis`: 256m memory
- All services: JSON log driver with 10m max-size, 3 file rotation

### 6. Fix N+1 Query Patterns ✅

- **Downloads API** was already using batch `.in()` query + Map — no change needed.
- **Summarize worker** now batch-fetches all transcripts upfront with `.in('episode_id', epIds)` and a Map lookup instead of one query per episode.

### 7. Enable Authentication ✅

Removed auth bypass in `app/dashboard/layout.tsx`. Supabase session checks and `onAuthStateChange` listener are now active. Unauthenticated users are redirected to `/login`.

### 8. Auto-Retry Failed Episodes ✅

New `workers/auto-retry.ts` runs every 4 hours via cron (minute :17). Resets failed episodes with `retry_count < 3` back to `pending` for automatic re-processing. Triggers the transcription pipeline when episodes are reset.

### 9. Dead-Letter Status for Persistent Failures ✅

Episodes that fail 3+ times are promoted to `dead` status by the auto-retry worker, stopping further retries. Migration `003_dead_status_index.sql` adds a partial index for efficient querying.

---

## Infrastructure — CI/CD ✅ COMPLETE

### 10. GitHub Actions CI/CD Pipeline ✅

- `.github/workflows/build.yml`: Builds Docker image on push to `main`, pushes to `ghcr.io/aestwick/kpfk-qir` tagged with `latest` + git SHA
- `docker-compose.yml` pulls pre-built image from ghcr.io (Dockerfile kept for local dev)
- `deploy-qir.sh`: One-command VPS deploy — git pull, docker compose pull, up -d, prune

## P2/P3 — Nice to Have

### 11. SSE Instead of Polling

The dashboard and jobs page poll every 5 seconds regardless of activity. Server-Sent Events would reduce unnecessary API calls and provide instant updates. Not worth the complexity until you have multiple concurrent users.

### 12. URL-Persisted Filters ✅

Episode filters (status, quarter, show, category, sort, page) are now stored in URL search params via `useSearchParams`. Users can bookmark filtered views and share links. Filters survive navigation.

### 13. Shared Toast/Notification System ✅

Extracted `app/components/toast.tsx` with `ToastProvider` and `useToast()` hook. Toasts auto-dismiss after 5 seconds with manual dismiss option. Replaced per-page state in dashboard overview, jobs, and settings pages.

### 14. Parallelize RSS Ingest ✅

RSS feeds are now fetched in parallel batches of 5 using `Promise.allSettled()`. Per-show logic extracted into `processShow()` helper.

### 15. Lazy-Load Dashboard Pages

All dashboard pages use `'use client'` and are bundled together. Use `next/dynamic` to lazy-load heavier pages (episode detail, QIR generator, settings). Low impact — the bundle is already small (~5KB per page).

### 16. ISR for Public QIR Page ✅

Public QIR page (`/[year]/q[quarter]`) now uses `revalidate = 86400` (24 hours). Finalized reports are cached and served statically.

### 17. Keyboard Shortcuts

Power users (station staff checking daily) would benefit from `J/K` to navigate episodes, `R` to retry, `/` to search. Pure convenience feature.

### 18. Timeline/Activity Log View

A historical timeline of all pipeline events. The 24h feed on the new dashboard covers the immediate need. A full history view can wait.

## Skip Entirely (For Now)

### Streaming Transcripts to Summarizer

The concern about sending full transcripts to GPT-4o-mini is valid in theory, but GPT-4o-mini's context window is 128k tokens. A 3-hour show produces roughly 30–40k tokens of transcript. You're well within limits for every show KPFK airs. Revisit only if you start processing unusually long content (multi-hour specials, fundraiser marathons).

### Waveform Audio Visualization

Cool but purely cosmetic. The existing audio player with VTT captions works. Not a priority for an internal tool.

### Diff View for Summary Edits

Showing original vs. edited summary in the episode detail page. Nice for auditing but the current inline edit is fine for 2–3 staff users.
